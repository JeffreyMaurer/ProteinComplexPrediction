# Protein Complex Prediction

This repository is devoted to my work on using LC/MS data to predict protein complexes. The data was taken from [this](https://github.com/marcottelab/direct_contact) repository by Marcotte lab and some code was taken from [this](https://github.com/mcrovella/CFMS) repository. The work here is a collaboration between Dr. Simon Kasif, Dr. Andrew Emili, Dr. Mark Crovella and Jeffrey Maurer.
